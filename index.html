     <div>
        <p class=cursive>I was born and raised in Minneapolis, MN and I moved to Texas six years ago. 
        For the past two years I have been working at Southwest Airlines. 
        At the beginning of 2018, I started teaching myself coding using free online resources and today 
        I am starting a Full stack Web Development Bootcamp with SMU. 
        I am excited to share my journey with you.</p>
